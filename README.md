# pAequor-Factory
Small project to create species and compare their DNA

Welcome!

In this small project I used JavaScript to create a species factory (object factory) and the end goal is to create an array with 30 different species (but with a catch! all of them need to be likely to survive).

Hope you enjoy it!

Best wishes, Nuno Martins
